An order is typically made either by telephone, through the supplier's website or mobile app, or through a third party food ordering service.";

The delivery person will normally drive a car, but in bigger cities where homes and restaurants are closer together, they may use bikes or motorized scooters.";

A flat rate delivery fee is often charged with what the customer has bought. Sometimes no delivery fees are charged depending upon the situation. Tips are often customary for food delivery service. Contactless delivery may also be an option.";

If they choose to create their own website, they make sure to obtain software that manages the orders efficiently, meaning it has the capability to manage different orders at once. When they hire a vendor, the restaurant pays for a monthly fee or percentage-based fees. The vendor covers the developmental costs.";
